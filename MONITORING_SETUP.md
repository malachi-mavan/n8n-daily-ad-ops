## üîç Daily Monitoring Checklist

### Week 1: Intensive Monitoring

#### Daily Checks (First 7 Days)
- [ ] **Execution Status**: Did workflow complete successfully?
- [ ] **Output Quality**: Are campaign names real (not placeholders)?
- [ ] **Alert Relevance**: Are creative alerts actionable and accurate?
- [ ] **Anomaly Detection**: Do anomalies meet $500+ spend threshold?
- [ ] **Slack Delivery**: Report posted to `internal_38tera_reports`?
- [ ] **Execution Time**: Completed within 5 minutes?
- [ ] **Error Count**: Any node failures or retries?

#### Quality Metrics to Track

##### Campaign Name Accuracy
- **Target**: 100% real campaign names
- **Track**: Count of placeholder vs real names
- **Red Flag**: Any "[Campaign A]" style placeholders

##### Alert Effectiveness
- **Target**: >80% actionable alerts
- **Track**: Which alerts led to actual optimizations
- **Red Flag**: >20% false positive rate

##### Data Completeness
- **Target**: <5% "Data unavailable" messages
- **Track**: Missing data frequency and causes
- **Red Flag**: Consistent data gaps in key metrics

### Week 2-4: Comparison Analysis

#### Enhanced vs Original Comparison

##### Daily Report Quality Score
Rate each report 1-10 on:
- **Campaign Name Accuracy** (placeholders vs real names)
- **Alert Relevance** (actionable vs noise)
- **Insight Depth** (surface vs actionable intelligence)
- **Time to Action** (how quickly issues are addressed)

##### Time Savings Measurement
- **Before**: Time spent analyzing original reports
- **After**: Time spent analyzing enhanced reports
- **Target**: 30+ minutes saved per day

##### Issue Detection Speed
- **Before**: Time to identify campaign problems
- **After**: Time to identify problems with enhanced alerts
- **Target**: 50% faster issue detection

## üö® Alert Thresholds Monitoring

### Creative Performance Alert Tracking

#### Frequency Alerts (>3.0 in 7 days)
- [ ] **Week 1**: Track frequency alert accuracy
- [ ] **Adjustment**: Is 3.0 threshold appropriate for this account?
- [ ] **Action Rate**: How often are frequency alerts acted upon?

#### CPM Spike Alerts (>25% from account average)
- [ ] **Week 1**: Track CPM spike alert relevance
- [ ] **Adjustment**: Is 25% threshold too sensitive/insensitive?
- [ ] **Market Context**: Are spikes due to external factors?

#### CTR Drop Alerts (>30% from 7-day average)
- [ ] **Week 1**: Track CTR drop alert accuracy
- [ ] **Adjustment**: Is 30% threshold appropriate?
- [ ] **Creative Fatigue**: Do alerts correlate with ad fatigue?

#### Conversion Rate Alerts (>40% drop with >$100 spend)
- [ ] **Week 1**: Track conversion rate alert relevance
- [ ] **Adjustment**: Are both thresholds (40%, $100) appropriate?
- [ ] **Tracking Issues**: Do alerts indicate technical problems?

### Anomaly Detection Performance

#### Breakthrough Detection (>50% improvement, $500+ spend)
- [ ] **True Positives**: Genuine breakthrough campaigns
- [ ] **False Positives**: Normal variance flagged as breakthroughs
- [ ] **Missed Opportunities**: Significant improvements not flagged

#### Critical Failure Detection (>50% decline or 0 conversions, $500+ spend)
- [ ] **True Positives**: Genuine critical failures
- [ ] **False Positives**: Temporary dips flagged as failures
- [ ] **Missed Issues**: Critical problems not flagged

## üìà Performance Benchmarks

### Success Metrics (30-Day Target)

#### Operational Efficiency
- **Daily Analysis Time**: Reduce from X minutes to X-30 minutes
- **Issue Resolution Time**: Reduce by 50%
- **Optimization Implementation**: Increase by 30%

#### Report Quality
- **Campaign Name Accuracy**: 100% real names
- **Alert Actionability**: >80% of alerts result in action
- **False Positive Rate**: <10% of alerts

#### Business Impact
- **Faster Issue Detection**: Critical problems identified same day
- **Better Optimization**: More specific, impact-quantified recommendations
- **Team Adoption**: Daily use of enhanced recommendations

## üîß Threshold Fine-Tuning Process

### Weekly Review Process

#### Week 1 Review
1. **Collect Data**: All alerts, execution logs, feedback
2. **Analyze Patterns**: Which thresholds are too sensitive/insensitive?
3. **Team Feedback**: Are recommendations actionable?
4. **Initial Adjustments**: Minor threshold tweaks if needed

#### Week 2-4 Reviews
1. **Trend Analysis**: Performance over time
2. **Comparative Analysis**: Enhanced vs original effectiveness
3. **ROI Assessment**: Time savings and optimization improvements
4. **Strategic Adjustments**: Major improvements or feature additions

### Threshold Adjustment Guidelines

#### Too Sensitive (>30% false positives)
- **Frequency**: Increase from 3.0 to 3.5
- **CPM**: Increase from 25% to 30%
- **CTR**: Increase from 30% to 35%
- **Spend threshold**: Increase from $500 to $750

#### Too Insensitive (missing obvious issues)
- **Frequency**: Decrease from 3.0 to 2.5
- **CPM**: Decrease from 25% to 20%
- **CTR**: Decrease from 30% to 25%
- **Spend threshold**: Decrease from $500 to $300

## üìù Feedback Collection

### Daily Feedback Questions
1. **Which alerts were most valuable today?**
2. **Which alerts were false positives?**
3. **What issues were missed by the alerts?**
4. **How much time did the enhanced report save?**
5. **What additional insights would be helpful?**

### Weekly Team Review
- **Alert Effectiveness**: Review all alerts from the week
- **Time Savings**: Quantify analysis time reduction
- **Optimization Impact**: Track implementations from recommendations
- **Improvement Suggestions**: What features would add more value?

## üéØ Decision Points

### Week 1: Immediate Issues
- **Major bugs**: Workflow failures, data errors
- **Critical false positives**: Alerts causing unnecessary panic
- **Missing critical alerts**: Obvious issues not flagged

### Week 2: Fine-Tuning
- **Threshold adjustments**: Based on sensitivity analysis
- **Alert relevance**: Remove or modify low-value alerts
- **Feature requests**: High-impact additions

### Week 4: Production Decision
- **Full deployment**: Replace original workflow permanently
- **Hybrid approach**: Use both for different purposes
- **Back to drawing board**: Significant issues require redesign
