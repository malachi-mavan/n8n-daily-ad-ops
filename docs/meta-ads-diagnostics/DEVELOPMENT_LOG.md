# Meta Ads Diagnostics - Development Log

## 2025-08-22 - v8 Production Ready ✅

### Major Release: v8 with Fixed Core Issues

**Issues Resolved from v7:**
1. **Report Title Missing**: Fixed truncated header, now shows full title with account ID and date
2. **DoD% Not Calculating**: Added explicit data retrieval for "day before yesterday" for proper DoD% comparison
3. **Unfair Week Comparisons**: Changed from partial current week vs full last week to L7D vs P7D (two full 7-day periods)

### v8 Key Improvements:

#### Data Retrieval Enhancement
- **Four Time Periods**: Yesterday, day before yesterday, L7D (Last 7 Days), P7D (Previous 7 Days)
- **L7D**: Yesterday + 6 days prior (complete 7-day period)
- **P7D**: Days -8 through -14 (complete 7-day comparison period)
- **Result**: Always apples-to-apples comparison of two full weeks

#### Output Format Fixes
- **Complete Header**: `` `META ADS DIAGNOSTICS REPORT` `` with full client info
- **Date Consistency**: "Aug 22, 2025" format throughout
- **Table Headers**: Changed to "L7D" and "P7D" for clarity

#### Production Deployment
- **Workflow ID**: `gY7MTV11ZqRLtywG`
- **Status**: Successfully uploaded to n8n
- **Test Result**: Perfect output format confirmed
