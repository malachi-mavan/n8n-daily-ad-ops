# Daily Ad Ops Checklist v3 - Enhancement Documentation

## Overview

Enhanced the "Daily Ad Ops Checklist v3" workflow based on user feedback and Meta Ads best practices research. The improvements focus on fixing campaign name placeholders, enhancing creative performance detection, and adding statistical anomaly analysis while preserving the core functionality.

## Key Issues Addressed

### 1. ✅ Campaign Name Placeholders Fixed
**Problem**: Output showed "[Campaign A]", "[Campaign B]" instead of actual names
**Solution**: Added explicit instructions to use actual campaign names from GoMarble MCP data

### 2. ✅ Enhanced Creative Performance Alerts  
**Problem**: Only looked at spend changes for creative issues
**Solution**: Expanded to include multiple performance indicators:
- **Frequency monitoring**: >3.0 in 7 days (based on Meta best practices research)
- **CPM spike detection**: >25% from account average (reduced from 40%)
- **CTR degradation**: >30% drop from 7-day average
- **Conversion rate issues**: >40% drop with >$100 spend

### 3. ✅ Statistical Anomaly Detection Added
**Problem**: No breakthrough/failure detection for significant changes
**Solution**: Added performance anomaly section with:
- **Minimum spend threshold**: $500 for statistical significance
- **Breakthrough detection**: >50% ROAS improvement or >40% CAC improvement  
- **Critical failure alerts**: >50% ROAS decline or 0 conversions with significant spend
- **Smart omission**: Section only appears when anomalies detected

### 4. ✅ Enhanced Data Validation
**Problem**: No guidance for handling missing/incomplete data
**Solution**: Added comprehensive validation instructions:
- PST/PDT timezone context for "yesterday"
- Data completeness verification
- Clear marking of unavailable data with context
- Data freshness timestamps

### 5. ✅ Performance Velocity Indicators
**Problem**: Limited trending context
**Solution**: Added momentum indicator based on 3-day vs 7-day trends

## Detailed Changes

### New Prompt Sections Added

#### Data Retrieval & Validation
```
- Use GoMarble MCP tools to retrieve actual campaign names, creative names, and performance data
- Verify data covers the full reporting period for yesterday
- Use PST/PDT timezone for "yesterday" calculations
- If data is missing or incomplete, mark as "Data unavailable" with context
```

#### Campaign & Creative Naming
```
- Always use actual campaign names from the data, never placeholders like "Campaign A"
- Use actual creative names from the data, never placeholders like "Creative Name"  
- If names are >40 characters, truncate with "..."
- Display real performance data, not placeholder values like "X,XXX"
```

### Enhanced Sections

#### 1. Header Enhancement
**Added**: Performance momentum indicator
```
Momentum: ↗️ Accelerating | ➡️ Stable | ↘️ Decelerating (Based on 3-day vs 7-day trends)
```

#### 2. Creative Performance Alerts (Completely Redesigned)
**Before**: Only day-over-day spend changes >20%
**After**: Comprehensive performance monitoring:
```
Alert Type                              | Asset Name | Metric | Status
----------------------------------------|------------|--------|--------
Spend drop/spike >20% day-over-day     | [Name]     | ↘️ -XX% | 🔴/🟡
CTR drop >30% from 7-day average       | [Name]     | ↘️ -XX% | 🔴/🟡  
Frequency >3.0 in last 7 days          | [Name]     | X.X    | 🔴/🟡
CPM spike >25% from account avg        | [Name]     | ↗️ +XX% | 🔴/🟡
Conv. rate drop >40% with >$100 spend  | [Name]     | ↘️ -XX% | 🔴/🟡
```

#### 3. Performance Anomalies (NEW SECTION)
**Added**: Statistical significance analysis for breakthroughs and failures
```
🚀 BREAKTHROUGHS:
Campaign/Ad Set Name                    | Metric Change | Current | Previous | Spend
[Name if >50% improvement]              | ROAS ↗️ +XX%  | X.XXx   | X.XXx    | $XXX

⚠️ CRITICAL FAILURES:
Campaign/Ad Set Name                    | Metric Change | Current | Previous | Spend  
[Name if >50% decline]                  | ROAS ↘️ -XX%  | X.XXx   | X.XXx    | $XXX
```

#### 4. Enhanced Status Summary
**Added**: Efficiency scoring
```
Efficiency Score: [A/B/C/D/F] - XX% of budget on profitable campaigns (ROAS >1)
```

#### 5. Impact-Based Action Items
**Enhanced**: Dollar impact estimates for prioritization
```
🔴 IMMEDIATE - Est. Impact: $XXX/day
• [Specific urgent action with dollar impact]

🟡 THIS WEEK - Est. Impact: $XXX/week
• [Medium priority optimization with potential value]

🟢 MONITOR - Current Value: $XXX/week
• [High-performing elements to maintain]
```

#### 6. Daily Comparison (NEW SECTION)
**Added**: Quick performance snapshot
```
VS YESTERDAY: Spend ↗️/↘️ ±XX% | CAC ↗️/↘️ ±XX% | ROAS ↗️/↘️ ±X.XXx
VS LAST [SAME DAY]: Spend ↗️/↘️ ±XX% | CAC ↗️/↘️ ±XX% | ROAS ↗️/↘️ ±X.XXx
TREND: Improving/Stable/Declining
```

#### 7. Performance Thresholds Reference (NEW)
**Added**: Clear criteria documentation
```
- ROAS: >1.0 = 🟢, 0.8-1.0 = 🟡, <0.8 = 🔴
- CAC trends: improving = 🟢, stable = 🟡, worsening = 🔴
- Frequency: <2.0 = 🟢, 2.0-3.0 = 🟡, >3.0 = 🔴
- CPM changes: <15% = 🟢, 15-25% = 🟡, >25% = 🔴
```

### System Message Enhancement
**Updated**: Added data validation and retrieval guidance
```
"You are an expert Meta Ads analyst with access to comprehensive advertising data through GoMarble MCP tools. 
Retrieve actual campaign names and performance data. Execute the analysis checklist and output ONLY the final 
formatted report starting immediately with the title. Use visual indicators (emojis, arrows) for quick scanning. 
No preamble or commentary. Include anomaly detection only for statistically significant changes."
```

### Technical Improvements
1. **Increased retry attempts**: From 2 to 3 for better reliability

- **Optimal frequency**: 1-2 exposures per week
- **Warning threshold**: 3.0+ (effectiveness drops significantly)
- **7-day monitoring window**: More appropriate than 24-hour for frequency assessment
- **Ad fatigue indicators**: Frequency >2 with declining CTR

### Statistical Significance Thresholds
- **Minimum spend**: $500 for reliable performance assessment
- **Breakthrough criteria**: >50% improvement (substantial impact)
- **Failure criteria**: >50% decline or zero conversions (critical issues)
