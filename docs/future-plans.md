# Future Development Plans

## Data Source Migration Strategy

### Current State
- **Primary Data Source**: GoMarble MCP (`https://apps.gomarble.ai/mcp-api/sse`)
- **Purpose**: Meta Ads performance data access for account ID `732630268714732`
- **Status**: Working but external dependency

### Future Migration Option: BigQuery

#### Benefits of BigQuery Migration
1. **Direct Data Access**: No external MCP dependency
2. **Better Performance**: Direct SQL queries vs API calls
3. **Enhanced Reliability**: Google Cloud infrastructure
4. **Advanced Analytics**: Native BigQuery ML capabilities
5. **Cost Optimization**: Direct data warehouse access

#### Migration Considerations
- **Data Pipeline**: Need to establish Meta Ads â†’ BigQuery sync
- **Schema Design**: Structure tables for ad performance metrics
- **Query Optimization**: Replace MCP calls with SQL queries
- **Authentication**: Service account setup for BigQuery access
- **Scheduling**: Ensure data freshness for daily reports

#### Implementation Phases
1. **Phase 1**: Parallel setup (keep GoMarble, add BigQuery)
2. **Phase 2**: A/B testing between data sources
3. **Phase 3**: Full migration if BigQuery proves superior
4. **Phase 4**: Deprecate GoMarble MCP dependency

### Other Future Enhancements

#### Report Improvements
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Move beyond static reports
- **Real-time Alerts**: Immediate notifications for critical issues
- **Historical Trending**: Week-over-week, month-over-month analysis
- **Automated Insights**: AI-generated recommendations

#### Workflow Enhancements
- **Multi-Account Support**: Scale beyond single account ID
- **Custom Metrics**: User-defined KPIs and thresholds
- **Integration Expansion**: Google Ads, TikTok Ads, LinkedIn Ads
- **Advanced Scheduling**: Different reports for different stakeholders

#### Technical Improvements
- **Error Resilience**: Better fallback mechanisms
- **Performance Optimization**: Faster execution times
- **Modular Design**: Reusable components across workflows
- **Version Control**: Better change management

## Decision Framework

### When to Migrate to BigQuery
- [ ] GoMarble MCP becomes unreliable
- [ ] Need for more complex data analysis
- [ ] Cost considerations favor direct access
- [ ] Performance requirements exceed current solution
- [ ] Need for real-time data processing

### Success Metrics for Migration
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime vs current solution
- **Performance**: <30 second execution time
- **Cost**: Cost per report execution
- **Functionality**: Feature parity + new capabilities

## Timeline Considerations
- **Short-term (1-3 months)**: Optimize current GoMarble solution
- **Medium-term (3-6 months)**: Evaluate BigQuery setup
- **Long-term (6+ months)**: Consider migration if benefits proven
