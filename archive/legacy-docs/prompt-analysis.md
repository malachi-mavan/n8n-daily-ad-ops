## Recommended Prompt Improvements

### 1. Add Data Retrieval Instructions
```
Before generating the report, use available MCP tools to:
1. Query Meta Ads data for account 732630268714732
2. Retrieve data for yesterday (previous business day)
3. Calculate week-to-date averages (Monday-current day)
4. Get same day last week comparison data
5. Verify data completeness before proceeding
```

### 2. Add Error Handling
```
If data is unavailable or incomplete:
- Clearly mark missing sections with "Data unavailable"
- Provide context for why data might be missing
- Include partial data with appropriate caveats
- Still generate actionable recommendations based on available data
```

### 3. Add Timezone Context
```
Use PST/PDT timezone for "yesterday" calculations.
If today is Monday, use Friday as "yesterday".
Account for Meta Ads reporting delays.
```

### 4. Enhance Metric Definitions
```
Calculations:
- CAC = Total Spend / Total Conversions
- ROAS = Total Conversion Value / Total Spend
- Trends = ((Current - Previous) / Previous) * 100
- Use purchase attribution window for conversion metrics
```

### 5. Add Data Quality Checks
```
Before generating report, verify:
- Data is for the correct date range
- Conversion tracking is active
- No major account changes in the period
- Data freshness (last updated timestamp)
```
